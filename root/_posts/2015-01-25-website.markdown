The irony isn't lost on us. After a year of great meetups about building the web as well as a full conference, that Style &amp; Class existed as mostly a Meetup group without its own permanent home on the web.

Well, we're finally fixing that today. We've been hard at work over the past month building this site. It's about 90% of the way there, 

We see this new site as a necessary first step toward a much expanded Style &amp; Class. The [organizing committee][organizers] has only started discussing what comes next, so while we can't be more than vague right now, you should expect more announcements over the coming months.



In the meantime, head on over to [our Meetup page][meetup] for future event details.
