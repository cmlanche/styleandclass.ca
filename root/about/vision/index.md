# Vision

Style &amp; Class is a Vancouver event series for those who design and develop
the web.

It's for designers who want to learn and share new techniques from concept all
the way to execution. It's for front-end developers who want to talk shop about
HTML, CSS, and creating great experiences. Most importantly, it's for people to
get involved in conversations about cutting edge design methods, brand new
development techniques, and brilliant experiments in user theory and interaction
strategies.

We aim to offer conference-quality talks and panels in a casual
environmentâ€”along with enough food and craft beer to keep you in your seat. Our
talks are targeted at industry professionals, but we welcome people of all skill
levels who are passionate about improving the way we build the web.
